  As an outdoor enthusiast shopper
  I want to click on each product link and verify the product page
  So that I can review multiple products and return to the catalog

  Scenario: Click on each product link, verify the page, and go back
    Given I am on the GMO Home Page
    And I click on the "Enter GMO OnLine" button
    When I click on each product link and verify the page:
      | Item Name | Product Name              |
